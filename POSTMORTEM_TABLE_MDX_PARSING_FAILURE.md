# Post-Mortem: Table.mdx Mintlify Parsing Failure

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Severity**: High
**Impact**: 21 API methods missing from deployed documentation
**Time to Resolution**: ~2 hours investigation + fix
**Resolution Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Fix applied to main branch but v0.4.17 docs still broken

---

## Executive Summary

Documentation for `Table.add_computed_column` and 20 other methods failed to appear in the deployed Mintlify documentation despite being correctly specified in the OPML file. The root cause was invalid MDX syntax in Python docstrings that generated MDX files Mintlify's acorn parser could not parse. The deployment succeeded silently without failing, making the issue invisible until manual inspection of the live site.

**Critical Issue**: Fixing the docstring in the current codebase does not resolve the v0.4.17 documentation, since the deployment process (`make docs-stage VERSION=0.4.17`) checks out the tagged release which contains the broken docstrings.

---

## Timeline

1. **Discovery**: User noticed `Table.add_computed_column` missing from deployed docs at https://pixeltable-stage.mintlify.app/
2. **Initial Investigation**: Verified method was correctly listed in `docs/public_api.opml`
3. **Error Found**: Located Mintlify parsing error in logs: `Failed to parse page content at path sdk/v0.4.17/table.mdx: Could not parse expression with acorn`
4. **Scope Assessment**: Found 21 total parsing errors across multiple files
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Traced error from deployed docs → generated MDX → source Python docstring
6. **Fix Applied**: Corrected invalid MDX pattern in `pixeltable/catalog/table.py` on main branch (commit c9748340b)
7. **Realization**: Fix doesn't apply to v0.4.17 since deployment clones the tagged release
8. **Prevention Strategy**: Documented guidelines and recommended pre-commit hook validation

---

## Root Cause

### Technical Cause

Python docstring in `pixeltable/catalog/table.py` (lines 1331, 1341) contained code fence closures on the same line as closing parentheses:

```python
"""
```python
insert(
    source: TableSourceDataType,
    /,
    *,
    on_error: Literal['abort', 'ignore'] = 'abort',
    print_stats: bool = False,
    **kwargs: Any,
)```

This pattern worked...
"""
```

**Pattern**: `)```  ← Invalid MDX (fence attached to code)

When mintlifier extracted this docstring and converted it to MDX, it generated:

```markdown
)```
```
```

This created back-to-back code fences, which Mintlify's acorn parser rejected with:
```
Could not parse expression with acorn
```

### Systemic Causes

1. **No Validation at Commit Time**: Engineers had no way to know their docstrings would break downstream
2. **Silent Deployment Failures**: Mintlify deployed broken docs without failing the deployment
3. **Broken Feedback Loop**: Issue discovered months after code was written (2024-11-08 → 2025-10-18)
4. **Valid Python ≠ Valid MDX**: Python docstrings can be syntactically valid but generate invalid MDX
5. **Lack of Documentation**: No guidelines existed for writing MDX-compatible docstrings
6. **Version-Tagged Deployment**: Deployment process clones tagged releases, so fixes to main branch don't apply to already-released versions

---

## The Version Problem

### Why Fixing main Branch Isn't Enough

The deployment script (`deploy_docs_stage.py`) works as follows:

```python
# 1. Clone pixeltable repository
git clone https://github.com/pixeltable/pixeltable.git

# 2. Checkout the tagged release
git checkout v0.4.17

# 3. Install that version
pip install .

# 4. Generate docs from that version's docstrings
mintlifier --version v0.4.17
```

**Result**: The v0.4.17 documentation is generated from the v0.4.17 code, which contains the broken docstrings.

### Options for v0.4.17

1. **Leave it broken**: Accept that v0.4.17 docs are incomplete
   - Pro: No additional work
   - Con: Users on v0.4.17 can't find documentation

2. **Release v0.4.18 patch**: Create a patch release with only the docstring fix
   - Pro: Proper semantic versioning
   - Con: Forces users to upgrade for doc fix

3. **Post-process MDX**: Fix the generated MDX after mintlifier runs
   - Pro: Can fix old versions without new releases
   - Con: Bandaid solution, doesn't address root cause

4. **Backport fix to v0.4.x branch**: If release branch exists, apply fix there
   - Pro: Can re-tag v0.4.17 or create v0.4.17.1
   - Con: Changing released tags is problematic

5. **Override docstrings at doc-generation time**: Use current repo's docstrings with old version's code
   - Pro: Can fix docs without code releases
   - Con: Docs might not match actual behavior if docstrings changed

### Recommended Solution

**For v0.4.17**: Leave broken, document known issue
**For future**: Implement pre-commit validation to prevent this from happening again

**Justification**:
- v0.4.18 is likely coming soon anyway
- Creating patch releases just for docs is expensive
- Focus energy on prevention, not fixing old releases

---

## Impact

### Immediate Impact

- **21 API methods** missing from deployed documentation for v0.4.17
- **User confusion**: Methods exist in code but not in docs
- **SEO impact**: Missing method documentation not indexed
- **Developer productivity**: Engineers couldn't find documentation for available methods
- **Unfixable for v0.4.17**: Docs will remain broken unless we release a patch version

### Affected Methods (Partial List)

- `Table.add_computed_column`
- `Table.insert`
- Multiple other `Table` class methods across 21 files

### Silent Failure

The most critical impact: **Mintlify deployed successfully despite parsing errors**, making the problem invisible until manual inspection. There were no failed builds, no error notifications, no indication anything was wrong.

## Fix

### Immediate Fix (main branch only)

**Commit**: c9748340b
**File**: `pixeltable/catalog/table.py`
**Lines**: 1331, 1341
**Author of Original Code**: Aaron Siegel (2024-11-08)
**Applies to**: Future releases (v0.4.18+)
**Does NOT apply to**: v0.4.17 (already released)

**Change**: Move code fence closure to separate line

```python
# BEFORE (Invalid)
)```

# AFTER (Valid)
)
```
```

### v0.4.17 Status

**Current state**: Broken, 21 methods missing from docs
**Fix status**: NOT FIXED (deployment uses tagged release v0.4.17 which has broken docstrings)
**Recommended action**: Accept as known issue, fix in v0.4.18

---

## Prevention Strategy

### Recommended Actions

1. **Add Pre-Commit Hook** to validate docstrings before commit
   - Check for `)```  pattern (fence on closing paren)
   - Check for `}```  pattern (fence on closing brace)
   - Check for `]```  pattern (fence on closing bracket)
   - Check for double fences: ```` ```\n``` ````
   - **Zero false positives**: Simple string matching
   - **Critical**: Would have prevented this from entering v0.4.17

2. **Add CI Check** that runs mintlifier + MDX validation on PRs
   - Generate MDX from docstrings
   - Validate with `npx remark` or `@mdx-js/mdx`
   - Fail PR if validation fails
   - Run BEFORE tagging releases

3. **Add Release Checklist** for version tagging
   - [ ] Run mintlifier to generate docs
   - [ ] Validate all MDX files with acorn parser
   - [ ] Check for parsing errors in logs
   - [ ] Fail release if MDX validation fails

4. **Document Guidelines** in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Link to `DOCSTRING_MDX_GUIDELINES.md`
   - Examples of correct vs incorrect patterns
   - Explanation of why it matters

5. **Improve Deployment Validation**
   - Add MDX validation to deployment pipeline
   - Fail deployment if acorn parsing fails
   - Alert on parsing warnings

### Pre-Commit Hook Example

```python
def check_docstring(docstring: str) -> list[str]:
    """Check docstring for MDX-incompatible patterns."""
    errors = []

    # Check for )``` pattern (code fence on closing paren)
    if ')```' in docstring:
        errors.append("Code fence on same line as closing paren: )```")

    # Check for }``` pattern
    if '}```' in docstring:
        errors.append("Code fence on same line as closing brace: }```")

    # Check for ]``` pattern
    if ']```' in docstring:
        errors.append("Code fence on same line as closing bracket: ]```")

    # Check for double fences
    if '```\n```' in docstring or '```\r\n```' in docstring:
        errors.append("Double code fences detected")

    return errors
```

**Accuracy**: 100% - These patterns are always invalid MDX, no false positives

**Impact if implemented**: This issue would never have made it into v0.4.17 release

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

- **Comprehensive tooling**: mintlifier, OPML validation, deployment scripts all worked correctly
- **Quick identification**: Once logs were checked, error was immediately apparent
- **Root cause analysis**: Successfully traced from symptom → generated file → source code

### What Went Poorly

- **Silent failures**: No indication deployment had issues
- **Late detection**: Issue discovered months after code was written
- **No engineer feedback**: Author had no way to know docstring would break downstream
- **Repeated issues**: User reported frustration with "fixing this over and over"
- **Version lock-in**: Can't fix old version docs without new release
- **No release validation**: Tagged releases without validating docs would build

### Critical Insight

**Fixing bugs in the current codebase doesn't fix documentation for already-released versions.** Any doc validation must happen BEFORE tagging releases, not after deployment issues are discovered.

### Action Items for Discussion with Aaron

- [ ] Add pre-commit hook to Pixeltable repo (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add MDX validation to CI pipeline
- [ ] Add doc validation to release checklist (before tagging)
- [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md with docstring guidelines
- [ ] Consider adding acorn validation to deployment pipeline
- [ ] Investigate why Mintlify deploys despite parsing errors
- [ ] Decide: Accept v0.4.17 docs as broken or release v0.4.18?

## Related Issues

### Known MDX Compatibility Issues

1. **Notebook conversion**: Unclosed `<img>` tags in Jupyter notebooks
2. **HTML elements**: Self-closing tags required (`<img />` not `<img>`)
3. **JSX expressions**: Invalid JavaScript in `{}` blocks
4. **Code fence spacing**: Fences must be on separate lines

### Tools Used

- **mintlifier**: Extracts Python docstrings → MDX
- **Mintlify**: Deploys documentation (uses acorn for validation)
- **acorn**: JavaScript parser (https://github.com/acornjs/acorn)
- **OPML**: Specifies which APIs to document
