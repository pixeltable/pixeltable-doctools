## Git Commits

We love Claude!!! ... but:
**Do NOT include Claude co-authoring credits in commit messages.**

Standard commit format:
```
Short description of changes

Optional longer description with details.
```

**No** "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" footer.
**No** "Co-Authored-By: Claude" line.
